# Movie Recommendation System Using Machine Learning

## Basic Idea
This project involves building a machine learning-based movie recommendation system. The system is designed to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and inputs. By analyzing patterns in user ratings and movie titles and certain other features, the recommendation system can identify similar movies and provide personalized suggestions to enhance the user experience.
